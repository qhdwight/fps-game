# FPS-Game
A creatily named shooter that has a destructible voxel terrain and a capture the flag gamemode. Each player can choose between several classes which each have their own weapons and special weapons. I made this because I enjoy video games but also wanted to learn how to code, as this taught me pretty much everything I know today. Please excuse the bugs, it was the first multiplayer and 3D game I ever made. Thanks for viewing!
